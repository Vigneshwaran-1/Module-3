# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
~~~
numbers = list(map(int, input("Enter numbers separated by spaces: ").split()))

total_sum = sum(numbers)

print(f"\nThe sum of all elements in the list is: {total_sum}")
~~~
## Output
~~~
Enter numbers separated by spaces: 3 5 7 9
The sum of all elements in the list is: 24
~~~

## Result
Thus given program is verified successfully
