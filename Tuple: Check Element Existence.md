# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
~~~
my_tuple = ('a', 'b', 'n', 4, 8, 'c')

has_n = 'n' in my_tuple
has_8 = 8 in my_tuple

print(f"Is 'n' present in the tuple? {has_n}")
print(f"Is 8 present in the tuple? {has_8}")
~~~
## Output
~~~
Is 'n' present in the tuple? True
Is 8 present in the tuple? True
~~~


## Result
Thus given program is verified successfully.
